        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <br>
        <h4>Aloha!</h4>
          <p>My name is Randee and I am new to the coding scene and decided to take this journey very recently. It's been an whirlwind since finding out about Epicodus, researching the school and resource options, deciding to enroll, and beginning class all within the span of three months. So far though, I am glad I did! I love the atmosphere and inclusivity of the program. Also, I am loving the way curriculum is set up to be learned as I am a visual learner and the Epicodus is helping me to learn and retain information the way I like to and prefer. Each day slowly eases my anxieties of this educated, but impulsed decision to attend this school, and reaffirms that I am on a great path.</p>
        <h4>LIH to PDX</h4>
          <p>I was born and raised on the island of Kaua'i. I came to Oregon to attend college in the fall of 2010 and became a resident in 2015. I decided to stay in Oregon post-graduation because Hawai'i is mostly conducive to certain professions. To continue to utilize my education and pursue media as a profession, I likely would have had to live on 'Oahu, so, hard PASS on that. <em>(Crowded by over-population in concentrated areas, traffic, expensive. Just no.)</em> So, although I miss home daily, I know that it is not where I need to be right now, and it would be a disservice to myself and my future. Also, it's so hard to go from the freedom of college to sharing a room with your teenage siblings and staying in while they go out on weekends to do teenage stuff. I've lost my tan completely, but I can adult, or at least attempt to more easily than if I were inundated with the high sales tax and insane cost of living in Hawai'i. <em>(For reference, a gallon of milk is like $9. So, Winco is the s###. Also, DOLLAR TREE?!!.)</em> Yeah, Portland's cool.</p>

        <h2>Why Epicodus, Why Coding?</h2>
        <p>A few months ago I was exploring local event options around Portland on Facebook, looking for an activity to entertain family that was going to be in town. I came across a posting for <span class="highlight">Epicods'</span> free Saturday Workshop, did a quick scan of the website, and was immediately intrgued. A month later I joined TechRise PDX and embarked on a new journey.<br><br>My decision to enroll in and attend the <span class="highlight">Epicodus</span> coding bootcamp is one that adjusts my sails, but does not steer me completely off my original course. During my undergraduate education, I had set my sights on landing a role within either of the studios or big name corporations in town. As with any creative industry, competition is steep and the job market is buzzing with talent. Through my hunting I have decided that learning a new trade to enhance my value could be the edge I need and the niche I have been searching for. The need for people who understand code increases with every tech advancement and new app idea, and I see myself as a part of the fulfilment. Having taken a couple classes throughout my different levels of schooling, coding has always been something I have been interested in and have dabbled in, but was never able to fully experience or delve into. In the long run, a career involving code provides opportunity, growth, stability, security, and an upward trajectory. Code will allow me the ability to bring my creative ideas to life where I would have previously had to seek the help of someone else. I <em>strongly</em> feel that adding the element of coding to my photo and video skillset will make me the multi-faceted employee employers search for. I am excited for the possibilities <span class="highlight">Epicodus</span> creates for my future. </p>
